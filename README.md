Default dotfiles to apply some basic configuration to:

* [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* [tmux](https://tmux.github.io)

## Highlights

* `<Space>` as `<leader>`
* `C-h/j/k/l` to navigate splits

**tmux** configuration:

* `C-q` as `<prefix>`
* Vi copy mode (including `C-v` & `y` support)
* `<prefix> + h/j/k/l` to navigate panes
* Split panes with current working directory
